    "You will implement different versions of agents that play \"Mean\" Connect 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Connect 4 is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.\" (see [Connect Four on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four))\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The mean part:** This game has an additional rule. Every time it is a player's turn, the player can decide to instead of playing a new disk, take a bottom row disk of the opponent and place it in any column. All disks above the removed disk will fall down one position. Note that a player can only move an _opponent's disc_ that is in the _bottom row_ of the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that normal [Connect-4 has been solved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four#Mathematical_solution)\n",
    "in 1988. A connect-4 solver with a discussion of how to solve different parts of the problem can be found here: https://connect4.gamesolver.org/en/"

    "Transition Model: Result(s, a) takes state s which is the current board, and then a is the action that changes the board.
